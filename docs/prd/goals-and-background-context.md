# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

* To provide users with a comprehensive financial analysis by ingesting single or multiple bank statements in various formats (PDF, Word, Image, Markdown).
* To automatically categorize expenses and identify spending patterns, helping users understand where their money is going.
* To offer predictive insights, such as savings projections over 1, 5, and 10-year horizons based on current habits.
* To deliver an interactive "financial co-pilot" via a chat interface, allowing users to ask specific, ad-hoc questions about their finances.
* To empower users with actionable commands, such as budget creation, goal setting, and advanced data exports (e.g., for taxes).

## Background Context

Users often possess a wealth of financial data in bank statements but lack the tools to easily consolidate and understand it. This project aims to solve that problem by creating an intelligent analysis tool powered by the Gemini AI model. It will transform static documents into a dynamic, interactive dashboard and conversational co-pilot. The goal is to move beyond simple reporting and provide users with a personalized, actionable platform to improve their financial health. The application will be deployed on Vercel, with a backend powered by MongoDB.
