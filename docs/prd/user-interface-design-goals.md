# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

The user experience will be defined by extreme simplicity and a focus on a single core action. The homepage will be minimalist and plain, featuring only a logo/name in the top-left corner and a central file upload component. This design creates a calm, focused environment that invites the user to engage immediately without the distraction of navigation or registration buttons. The aesthetic should be clean, modern, and trustworthy.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

* **Upload-First Gating**: User authentication (Login/Register) is intentionally gated *after* the user has shown intent by uploading files and clicking "Analyze," creating a seamless entry point.
* **Scroll-to-Reveal**: Secondary information, such as a "How it Works" demo, is revealed progressively as the user scrolls down the homepage.
* **Conversational Analysis**: The core analysis experience is a dialogue with the AI co-pilot, designed around a chat-first interface.

## Core Screens and Views

* **Homepage**: A minimalist screen with a logo and a central upload component. On scroll, it reveals explanatory content.
* **Login/Register Screen**: A combined screen that appears *only after* the "Analyze" button is clicked.
* **Analysis Dashboard**: The main view where the generated report and the chat co-pilot are displayed.
* **History Page**: A list view of all past analysis reports.
* **Account Settings**: A page for managing profile details.

## Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA

The application should be designed to meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA conformance.
