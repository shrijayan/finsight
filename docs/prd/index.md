Of course. Based on our entire conversation, I will now generate a single, complete Product Requirements Document (PRD).

This document consolidates all the sections we've discussed, incorporates your feedback, and resolves the "BLOCKER" issues we identified in the validation checklist by adding **Success Metrics** and specific **Reliability Requirements**.

This PRD is now ready to be handed off to the Architect.
