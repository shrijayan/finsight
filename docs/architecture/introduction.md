# Introduction

[cite_start]This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for the Bank Statement Analyzer, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration[cite: 880]. [cite_start]It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack[cite: 881]. [cite_start]This unified approach will streamline the development process for this modern fullstack application[cite: 882].

## Starter Template or Existing Project

Based on the PRD's technical assumptions, this greenfield project will be built using the **Next.js framework**. Next.js acts as our starter template, providing a pre-configured, production-ready environment for both the frontend (React) and the serverless backend (API Routes). [cite_start]This choice significantly accelerates setup and ensures we adhere to Vercel's best practices from the start[cite: 838, 842].
