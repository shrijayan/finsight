# Deployment Architecture

This section describes how our application will be automatically built and deployed to our hosting platform, Vercel.

## Deployment Strategy

  * **Frontend Deployment:**

      * **Platform:** **Vercel**
      * **Build Command:** `pnpm build` (Managed by Turborepo)
      * **Output Directory:** `apps/web/.next`
      * **CDN/Edge:** The application will be served via **Vercel's global Edge Network** for optimal performance and caching.

  * **Backend Deployment:**

      * **Platform:** **Vercel**
      * **Deployment Method:** **Serverless Functions**. Each API route in our Next.js application will be deployed as an independent serverless function.

## CI/CD Pipeline

We will use Vercel's built-in, Git-integrated CI/CD pipeline. The workflow will be as follows:

1.  **Push to `main` branch:**
      * Vercel automatically triggers a new deployment.
      * **Pipeline Steps:** Lint -\> Test -\> Build -\> Deploy to Staging.
      * A unique preview URL is generated for this deployment for review.
2.  **Promote to Production:**
      * Once a deployment is tested and approved, it can be promoted to the production domain directly from the Vercel dashboard.

# On push to `main` branch
- job: Build & Deploy Preview
  steps:
    - checkout_code
    - install_dependencies: pnpm install
    - lint_code: pnpm lint
    - run_tests: pnpm test
    - build_app: pnpm build
    - deploy_to_vercel_preview
```

## Environments

| Environment | Frontend URL | Backend URL | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Development** | `http://localhost:3000` | `http://localhost:3000/api` | Local development and testing. |
| **Staging** | `project-<hash>.vercel.app` | `project-<hash>.vercel.app/api` | Automatic preview deployments for testing before production. |
| **Production** | `your-domain.com` | `your-domain.com/api` | Live environment for end-users. |

This automated deployment architecture ensures that we can release new features and fixes rapidly and reliably.
