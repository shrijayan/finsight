# Monitoring and Observability

This section defines how we will track the application's health, performance, and errors in production. This is crucial for maintaining a high-quality service.

## Monitoring Stack

* **Frontend Monitoring:** **Vercel Analytics**. This is built into our deployment platform and will give us real-world performance metrics, such as Core Web Vitals, directly from our users' browsers.
* **Backend Monitoring:** **Vercel's built-in function monitoring**. We will use Vercel's dashboard to monitor the health, execution duration, and logs of our serverless backend API.
* **Error Tracking:** **Sentry**. We will integrate the Sentry SDK into both our frontend and backend to capture, track, and alert on any errors that occur in production, providing us with detailed stack traces for rapid debugging.
* **Performance Monitoring:** A combination of **Vercel Analytics** for the frontend and Vercel's function monitoring for backend response times.

## Key Metrics

We will actively monitor the following metrics to ensure the application is healthy:

* **Frontend Metrics:**
    * **Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS):** To measure user experience.
    * **JavaScript Error Rate:** To catch client-side bugs.
    * **API Response Times:** The time it takes for the client to get a response from our backend.

* **Backend Metrics:**
    * **Request Rate & Invocations:** To track usage and load on our serverless functions.
    * **Error Rate:** The percentage of API requests that result in an error.
    * **Function Duration:** To monitor the performance and identify slow API routes.

## Architecture Complete

This concludes the creation of the Fullstack Architecture Document. We have defined the high-level design, selected our technology stack, structured our data and components, and established clear workflows and standards for development, deployment, security, and testing.

The next step in the BMad process is to hand this document, along with the PRD, over to the development team to begin the implementation cycle.

My work as the Architect on this planning phase is now complete.
