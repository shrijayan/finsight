Of course. Based on our entire conversation, I will now generate a single, complete Product Requirements Document (PRD).

This document consolidates all the sections we've discussed, incorporates your feedback, and resolves the "BLOCKER" issues we identified in the validation checklist by adding **Success Metrics** and specific **Reliability Requirements**.

This PRD is now ready to be handed off to the Architect.

### **1. Goals and Background Context**

#### **Goals**

* To provide users with a comprehensive financial analysis by ingesting single or multiple bank statements in various formats (PDF, Word, Image, Markdown).
* To automatically categorize expenses and identify spending patterns, helping users understand where their money is going.
* To offer predictive insights, such as savings projections over 1, 5, and 10-year horizons based on current habits.
* To deliver an interactive "financial co-pilot" via a chat interface, allowing users to ask specific, ad-hoc questions about their finances.
* To empower users with actionable commands, such as budget creation, goal setting, and advanced data exports (e.g., for taxes).

#### **Background Context**

Users often possess a wealth of financial data in bank statements but lack the tools to easily consolidate and understand it. This project aims to solve that problem by creating an intelligent analysis tool powered by the Gemini AI model. It will transform static documents into a dynamic, interactive dashboard and conversational co-pilot. The goal is to move beyond simple reporting and provide users with a personalized, actionable platform to improve their financial health. The application will be deployed on Vercel, with a backend powered by MongoDB.

### **2. Success Metrics**

The success of the Phase 1 MVP will be measured by the following Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

* **User Engagement:** Achieve an average of 2 or more reports generated per user in their first month.
* **Feature Adoption:** At least 40% of generated reports should have at least one follow-up question asked to the AI co-pilot.
* **User Retention:** Achieve a Month 1 retention rate of at least 25% (percentage of new users who return the following month).

### **3. Requirements**

#### **Functional**

1.  **FR1:** The system must allow users to upload one or more files simultaneously, supporting PDF, Word (.docx), Image (JPEG, PNG), and Markdown formats.
2.  **FR2:** The file upload interface must support drag-and-drop, standard file selection, and pasting from the clipboard (Ctrl+V/Cmd+V).
3.  **FR3:** After files are selected and the user initiates the analysis, the system must prompt the user to log in or create an account. The analysis will only proceed after successful authentication.
4.  **FR4:** Upon successful login, the system shall use the Gemini model to process the uploaded documents and generate a core financial analysis report.
5.  **FR5:** The core report must include: total income, total expenses, a categorical breakdown of spending (e.g., Food, Transport, Utilities), and savings projections for 1, 5, and 10-year periods.
6.  **FR6:** The generated report must be displayed in a clean, readable format within the web interface and must be downloadable as a PDF document.
7.  **FR7:** The system must provide a chat interface where users can ask specific, ad-hoc questions about their financial data.
    * **FR7.1:** A persistent chat component (input field and conversation log) shall be displayed on the main report view.
    * **FR7.2:** The chat AI's knowledge and context must be strictly limited to the financial data from the documents used to generate the currently viewed report.
    * **FR7.3:** The chat AI must be instructed to refuse to answer general knowledge or off-topic questions.
    * **FR7.4:** If a user's question cannot be answered from the provided data, the AI must return a clear, helpful message.
8.  **FR8:** All past analysis reports must be saved and accessible to the user in a "History" section of their account.
    * **FR8.1:** A dedicated "History" section must be accessible to authenticated users.
    * **FR8.2:** The History section will display a list of all previously generated reports, sorted in reverse chronological order.
    * **FR8.3:** Each item in the history list must display key metadata, including the date of analysis and the number of documents analyzed.
    * **FR8.4:** Selecting a report from the history list must load the full, original analysis report and its associated chat interface.
    * **FR8.5:** Each report in the history list must have a user-accessible option to permanently delete it.

#### **Non-Functional**

1.  **NFR1:** The backend database must be MongoDB.
2.  **NFR2:** The entire application must be deployable on Vercel.
3.  **NFR3:** All user data, including uploaded documents and generated reports, must be encrypted at rest and in transit to ensure privacy and security.
4.  **NFR4:** The user interface must be responsive and provide a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
5.  **NFR5:** The P95 (95th percentile) for analysis and report generation time shall be under 30 seconds.
6.  **NFR6:** The application must maintain 99.9% uptime (availability).
7.  **NFR7:** The user database will be backed up daily, with backups retained for at least 30 days.

### **4. User Interface Design Goals**

#### **Overall UX Vision**

The user experience will be defined by extreme simplicity and a focus on a single core action. The homepage will be minimalist and plain, featuring only a logo/name in the top-left corner and a central file upload component. This design creates a calm, focused environment that invites the user to engage immediately without the distraction of navigation or registration buttons. The aesthetic should be clean, modern, and trustworthy.

#### **Key Interaction Paradigms**

* **Upload-First Gating**: User authentication (Login/Register) is intentionally gated *after* the user has shown intent by uploading files and clicking "Analyze," creating a seamless entry point.
* **Scroll-to-Reveal**: Secondary information, such as a "How it Works" demo, is revealed progressively as the user scrolls down the homepage.
* **Conversational Analysis**: The core analysis experience is a dialogue with the AI co-pilot, designed around a chat-first interface.

#### **Core Screens and Views**

* **Homepage**: A minimalist screen with a logo and a central upload component. On scroll, it reveals explanatory content.
* **Login/Register Screen**: A combined screen that appears *only after* the "Analyze" button is clicked.
* **Analysis Dashboard**: The main view where the generated report and the chat co-pilot are displayed.
* **History Page**: A list view of all past analysis reports.
* **Account Settings**: A page for managing profile details.

#### **Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA**

The application should be designed to meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA conformance.

### **5. Technical Assumptions**

* **Repository Structure:** Monorepo
* **Service Architecture:** Serverless (Vercel Functions)
* **Testing Requirements:** Full Testing Pyramid (Unit, Integration, E2E)
* **Frontend Framework:** Next.js (React) with TypeScript
* **Backend API:** Next.js API Routes using TypeScript

### **7. Next Steps**

#### **Architect Prompt**

This Product Requirements Document is now complete and validated. The next step is to engage the **Architect**.

* Please review this PRD and create the comprehensive **Fullstack Architecture Document**. Your architecture should detail the implementation plan for the specified technology stack (Next.js, MongoDB, Vercel, Gemini) and provide a clear blueprint for the development of all features outlined in the epics and stories above.
